# Project Overview

This repository contains two separate projects, each addressing a specific task as outlined in the assignment.

## Task 1: Azure Functions Project

The first project is an Azure Functions application that periodically fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and stores the results in Azure Table Storage and Blob Storage. This project is designed to run automatically and provide RESTful endpoints for querying the stored data.

## Task 2: ASP.NET Core MVC Project

The second project is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that fetches weather data for multiple cities, stores it in a SQL database, and visualizes the data using a React-based frontend. This project integrates backend data handling with a modern web frontend for easy data access and visualization.

## Comments and Code Readability

Throughout both projects, I made an effort to comment the code as thoroughly as possible without overloading it with unnecessary details. My goal was to maintain clarity and readability, ensuring that the purpose of each section is clear, while still keeping the code concise and easy to follow.

## Project-Specific Details

Detailed descriptions of each project, including setup instructions and usage details, can be found in the respective `README.md` files within each project directory.

## Contact and Questions

I would be more than happy to explain any part of the project or discuss the design decisions I made along the way. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Comment

I sincerely apologize for the delay in completing this task and taking the whole week to finish it. Unfortunately, I fell ill during the allotted time, which impacted my ability to finish as quickly as I had planned. Thank you for your understanding.
